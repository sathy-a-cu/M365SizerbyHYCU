## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### ⚠️ Avoiding Repeated Admin Approval Requests

**Problem:** If you're getting repeated "Approval required" prompts every time you run the script, this is because the script uses **delegated permissions** (user-based authentication) which require admin approval for each session.

**Solution:** Use **Application Authentication** instead, which only requires one-time admin consent.

### Using App Authentication (Recommended for Repeated Use)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No repeated approval requests
- ✅ Works for automation and scheduled runs
- ✅ More secure for production environments
- ✅ One-time admin consent only

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Create an Azure AD App Registration:**
   - Go to Azure Portal → Azure Active Directory → App registrations
   - Click "New registration"
   - Name: "HYCU M365 Sizing Tool"
   - Supported account types: "Accounts in this organizational directory only"
   - Click "Register"
   - **Copy the Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**

2. **Configure API Permissions:**
   - Go to "API permissions" in your app
   - Click "Add a permission" → "Microsoft Graph" → "Application permissions"
   - Add these permissions:
     - `Reports.Read.All`
     - `User.Read.All`
     - `Group.Read.All`
     - `Team.ReadBasic.All`
     - `Sites.Read.All`
   - Click "Grant admin consent" (this is the **one-time approval**)
   - Verify all permissions show "Granted for [Your Organization]"

3. **Create a Client Secret:**
   - Go to "Certificates & secrets"
   - Click "New client secret"
   - Add description: "HYCU M365 Sizing Tool"
   - Choose expiration (recommend 24 months)
   - Click "Add"
   - **Copy the secret value immediately** (you won't see it again)

4. **Run with app authentication:**
   ```powershell
   .\Get-HYCUM365SizingInfo.ps1 -OutputPath "./output" -Period 30 -ClientId "YOUR_APP_ID" -ClientSecret "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" -TenantId "YOUR_TENANT_ID"
   ```

**Example with real values:**
```powershell
.\Get-HYCUM365SizingInfo.ps1 -OutputPath "./output" -Period 30 -ClientId "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc" -ClientSecret "your-secret-value-here" -TenantId "87654321-4321-4321-4321-987654321def"
```

### 🔄 Switching Between Authentication Methods

**Interactive Authentication (Default):**
- Uses your user account
- Requires admin approval each time
- Good for one-time analysis
- ```powershell
  .\Get-HYCUM365SizingInfo.ps1
  ```

**Application Authentication (Recommended):**
- Uses app registration
- One-time admin consent
- Good for repeated use and automation
- ```powershell
  .\Get-HYCUM365SizingInfo.ps1 -ClientId "your-app-id" -ClientSecret "your-secret" -TenantId "your-tenant-id"
  ```

### Customizing the Analysis

**Skip certain analyses:**
```powershell
.\Get-HYCUM365SizingInfo.ps1 -SkipArchiveMailbox $true -SkipRecoverableItems $true
```

**Custom growth rate:**
```powershell
.\Get-HYCUM365SizingInfo.ps1 -AnnualGrowth 25
```

**Custom output location:**
```powershell
.\Get-HYCUM365SizingInfo.ps1 -OutputPath "C:\Reports"
```

**Filter to specific group:**
```powershell
.\Get-HYCUM365SizingInfo.ps1 -ADGroup "Sales Team"
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Approval required" appears every time:**
- **Problem:** Using interactive authentication requires admin approval each session
- **Solution:** Use application authentication (see Advanced Usage section above)
- **Quick Fix:** Create an Azure AD app registration and use `-ClientId`, `-ClientSecret`, and `-TenantId` parameters

**"Module not found" error:**
```powershell
# Install missing modules
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Reports -Force -AllowClobber
```

**"Access denied" error:**
- Ensure you're using a Global Administrator account
- Check that your account has the required permissions
- Try running PowerShell as Administrator

**"Authentication failed" error:**
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try a different browser
- Ensure your account has MFA configured properly
- For app authentication: verify ClientId, ClientSecret, and TenantId are correct

**"No data returned" error:**
- Check your Microsoft 365 license (some features require specific licenses)
- Ensure your tenant has been active for at least 30 days
- Verify API permissions are granted

### Getting Help

**Check the script output:**
- The script provides detailed progress messages
- Look for error messages in red text
- Check the final summary for any warnings

**Verify permissions:**
```powershell
# Check your current permissions
Get-MgContext
```

**Test connectivity:**
```powershell
# Test Microsoft Graph connection
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "User.Read.All"
Get-MgUser -Top 1
```

## 💰 Cost Analysis Assumptions

The HYCU M365 Sizing Tool uses specific assumptions for cost calculations. Understanding these assumptions is crucial for accurate backup planning and budgeting.

### **📊 Storage Cost Calculations**

**Base Storage Costs:**
- **Storage Cost:** $0.02 per GB per month
- **Annual Storage Cost:** $0.24 per GB per year
- **Calculation Method:** Based on compressed and projected storage requirements

**Data Processing Assumptions:**
- **Compression Rate:** 40% (data compression reduces storage requirements by 40%)
- **Growth Rate:** 20% (annual data growth projection)
- **Retention Period:** 1 year (standard backup retention)
- **Daily Change Rate:** 0.2% (daily data change rate for incremental backups)

**Storage Calculation Formula:**
```
Original Storage → Compressed Storage (40% reduction) → Projected Storage (20% growth)
Example: 100 GB → 60 GB (compressed) → 72 GB (with growth)
```

### **🖥️ Worker Node Costs**

**Worker Node Pricing:**
- **Cost per TB per Month:** $8
- **Calculation Base:** Pre-compression tenant size (original data size)
- **Scaling Factor:** Based on total tenant size in TB
- **Purpose:** Processing power for backup operations

**Worker Node Calculation:**
```
Worker Node Cost = (Tenant Size in TB) × $8 per TB per month
$5-$8 is the typical range. Sizer takes the conservative route. 
```

### **📈 Growth Projections**

**Growth Rate Options:**
- **Default Annual Growth:** 30% (customizable via `-AnnualGrowth` parameter)
- **Standard Growth Rates:** 10%, 20%, and custom rate
- **Projection Method:** Linear growth calculation over 1 year

**Growth Calculation:**
```
Projected Size = Current Size × (1 + Growth Rate / 100)
```

### **🔑 HYCU Licensing Model**

**HYCU Entitlement Structure:**
- **Base Entitlement:** 50 GB per licensed user
- **Shared Mailbox Allowance:** 20% of licensed users (free shared mailboxes)
- **Additional License Cost:** Based on excess capacity requirements

**Licensing Calculation:**
```
HYCU Entitlement = Licensed Users × 50 GB
Additional Licenses = Ceiling((Current Usage - Entitlement) / 50 GB)
```

### **💬 Microsoft Teams Cost Implications**

**Teams Private Chat Protection:**
- **Cost per Message:** $0.00075 per message/notification
- **Cost per Million Messages:** $750
- **Impact:** Additional Microsoft licensing costs for Teams private chat protection
- **Consideration:** Factor into backup planning for Teams-heavy environments

### **⚙️ Customizable Parameters**

**Script Parameters for Cost Adjustments:**
```powershell
# Custom growth rate (default: 30%)
.\Get-HYCUM365SizingInfo.ps1 -AnnualGrowth 25

# Custom analysis period (default: 30 days)
.\Get-HYCUM365SizingInfo.ps1 -Period 60
```

### **📋 Cost Breakdown Example**

For a tenant with 100 users and 500 GB of data:

| Component | Calculation | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Storage (Compressed + Growth)** | 500 GB → 300 GB → 360 GB × $0.02 | $7.20 |
| **Worker Node** | 0.49 TB × $8 | $3.92 |
| **Total Monthly** | | $11.12 |
| **Total Annual** | $11.12 × 12 | $133.44 |
| **Per User Cost** | $133.44 ÷ 100 users | $1.33/user/year |

### **🔍 Understanding Cost Variations**

**Factors that affect costs:**
- **Data Growth Rate:** Higher growth = higher projected costs
- **Compression Efficiency:** Better compression = lower storage costs
- **Tenant Size:** Larger tenants = higher worker node costs
- **Teams Usage:** Heavy Teams usage = additional Microsoft licensing costs

**Cost Optimization Tips:**
- Monitor actual data growth vs. projections
- Consider data archiving strategies
- Evaluate Teams usage patterns
- Review shared mailbox allocation
